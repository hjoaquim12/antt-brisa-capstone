-- Silver: clean rows ready for star-schema joins.
--
-- Decisions captured here:
--   1. mes_ano (Mon-YY) parses to a real DATE (first day of month). The
--      two-digit year window is corrected so 'Jan-10' resolves to 2010,
--      not 1910.
--   2. Negative volume_total rows (3 in source) are dropped; this is
--      flagged in the Gold contract as a known caveat.
--   3. Categoria is dropped: tipo_de_veiculo carries the same signal
--      with three clean values instead of forty-six messy ones.
--   4. Sentido is left as-is; harmonizing across concessionaires would
--      need a manual lookup the dataset does not carry.
--   5. The model aggregates to the chosen grain so the uniqueness test
--      below holds and Gold can pass volume through without re-summing.
